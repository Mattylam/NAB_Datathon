## Project Overview
Deriving insights about national waste management database. 
Clean and preprocess data and make sure its ready for analysis
Identify potential correlations or dependencies in the data
Visualize using appropriate data visualization techniques to identify
patterns and trends

Predicting future waste generation
Utilize predictive modelling to forecast future waste generation using
‘Tonnes’ column as a target variable
Evaluate your model using appropriate evaluation metric

## Data Overview 
Year : Financial year. Data is presented for each year between 2006-07 and
2020-21 except 2007-08, 2011-12 and 2012-13, for which years a national data
set was not developed.
Jurisdiction : State or territory in which the waste was generated.
Category: A broad classification of waste material.
Type: A more detailed classification of waste material. For example, the
category 'Metals' may be split into : 'Aluminium', 'Non-ferrous metals (ex.
aluminium)', and 'Iron and steel'.
Classification : A reference field stating whether the particular row represents a
'type', 'category' or 'total' (totals collate categories in different ways).
Total type: Describes which category each data point classified as 'Total' refers
to.
Stream : Describes the source of waste, comprising three options: municipal
solid waste (MSW) from households and council operations; commercial and
industrial (C&I) waste; and construction and demolition (C&D) waste (plus a
total collating all three).
Management: Refers to the infrastructure that receives waste (e.g. landfill,
compost facility, alternative waste treatment facility).
Fate: The ultimate destination of the waste, comprising five options: disposal;
recycling; energy recovery; long-term storage; and waste reuse.
Tonnes: The quantity of waste.
Core or non-core : Lists whether the waste is 'core waste' or not.

## Data Wrangling
Preprocess_data.ipynb processes the Database file so we can do better data analysis. The data contains missing file from 2005, 2012 and 2014. 
It also only contains mining data from 2018-2021. 

## Data Analysis
Describe the data analysis techniques and approaches used in NAB_Datathon.
